# Wine-Quality-Prediction
 To predict the quality of wine by prediction using support vector machine (SVM) Machine Learning Algorithms.

SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable. A separator between the categories is found, then the data are transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane.
